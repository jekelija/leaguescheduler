TODO
Create new session, browse between sessions
in breadcrumb, allow changing of dates
All views must follow interface, need to be something over top of all of them that controls sliding and breadcrumbs, so we can tie a breadcrumb to a view

UX
Auto login/navigate to current session based on date. Header has previous/next session arrows, plus an "all sessions" that takes to grid view
Night/league/team in their settings menu have a "copy to session" section, expand/collapse with checkmarks for the next level below (league copy has checkmarks for teams to copy) and a checkmark for "copy all restrictions"
