TODO
Create new session, browse between sessions
in breadcrumb, allow changing of dates

UX
Auto login/navigate to current session based on date. Header has previous/next session arrows, plus an "all sessions" that takes to grid view
Night/league/team in their settings menu have a "copy to session" section, expand/collapse with checkmarks for the next level below (league copy has checkmarks for teams to copy) and a checkmark for "copy all restrictions"
